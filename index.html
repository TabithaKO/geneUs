        <h2>Sickle cell anemia</h2>
        <P>Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout your body.</P>
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Anameia</li>
          <li>Periodic pain</li>
          <li>Painful swelling of hands and feet</li>
          <li>Frequent infections.</li>
          <li>Delayed growth</li>
          <li>Vision problems</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Chronic conditions</h3>
        <p>Unexplained episodes of severe pain, such as pain in the abdomen, chest, bones or joints.</p>
        <p>Swelling in the hands or feet.</p>
        <p>Abdominal swelling, especially if the area is tender to the touch.</p> 
        <p>Fever. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection.</p>
         <p>Pale skin or nail beds.</p>
         <p>Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyes</p>
         <p>Yellow tint to the skin or whites of the eyesy.</p> 
         <h3>Complications</h3>
         <p>Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Stroke. A stroke can occur if sickle cells block blood flow to an area of your brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of your arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your baby or child has any of these signs and symptoms, seek medical treatment immediately. A stroke can be fatal.</li>
          <li>Acute chest syndrome. This life-threatening complication causes chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in your lungs. It might require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments.</li>
          <li>Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This complication usually affects adults rather than children. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal.</li>
          <li>Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply your eyes. Over time, this can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images (retina) and lead to blindness.</li>
          <li>Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow through blood vessels immediately deprive the affected organ of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood is also chronically low on oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs in your body, including your kidneys, liver and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal.</li>
          <li>Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause open sores, called ulcers, on your legs.</li>
          <li>Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in your body can lead to gallstones</li>
          
        </ol>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
         <p>If you carry the sickle cell trait, seeing a genetic counselor before trying to conceive can help you understand your risk of having a child with sickle cell anemia. He or she can also explain possible treatments, preventive measures and reproductive options.</p>

        <h2>Cystic fibrosis</h2>
        <p>Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time.</p>
        <p>In the lungs, the mucus clogs the airways and traps germs, like bacteria, leading to infections, inflammation, respiratory failure, and other complications. For this reason, minimizing contact with germs is a top concern for people with CF.</p>
        <p>In the pancreas, the buildup of mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that help the body absorb food and key nutrients, resulting in malnutrition and poor growth. In the liver, the thick mucus can block the bile duct, causing liver disease. In men, CF can affect their ability to have children.</p>
        <h3>Symptoms of CF</h3>
        <p>People with CF can have a variety of symptoms, including:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Very salty-tasting skin</li>
        <li>Persistent coughing, at times with phlegm</li>
        <li>Frequent lung infections including pneumonia or bronchitis</li>
        <li>Wheezing or shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Poor growth or weight gain in spite of a good appetite</li>
        <li>Male infertility</li>
        <li>Frequent greasy, bulky stools or difficulty with bowel movements</li>
      </ol>
        <h3>Diagnosis and Genetics</h3>
        <p>People with only one copy of the defective CF gene are called carriers, but they do not have the disease. Each time two CF carriers have a child, the chances are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>25 percent (1 in 4) the child will have CF</li>
          <li>50 percent (1 in 2) the child will be a carrier but will not have CF</li>
          <li>5 percent (1 in 4) the child will not be a carrier and will not have CF</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The defective CF gene contains a slight abnormality called a mutation.</p>
        <p>There are more than 1,700 known mutations of the disease. Most genetic tests only screen for the most common CF mutations. Therefore, the test results may indicate a person who is a carrier of the CF gene is not a carrier.</p>
        <h3>Advisory</h3>
        <p>To couple at risk of giving birth to a child with the the disease;<br>Diagnosing cystic fibrosis is done through a newborn screening, a sweat test, a genetic or carrier test, and a clinical evaluation </p>
        <h3>Management</h3>
        Cystic fibrosis are managed through a combination of the follwing therapies;
        <ol>
        <li>Airway clearance to help loosen and get rid of the thick mucus that can build up in the lungs.</li>
        <li>Inhaled medicines to open the airways or thin the mucus. These are liquid medicines that are made into a mist or aerosol and then inhaled through a nebulizer and include antibiotics to fight lung infections and therapies to help keep the airways clear.</li>
        <li>Pancreatic enzyme supplement capsules to improve the absorption of vital nutrients. These supplements are taken with every meal and most snacks. People with CF also usually take multivitamins.</li>
        <li>An individualized fitness plan to help improve energy, lung function, and overall health</li>
        <li>CFTR modulators to target the underlying defect in the CFTR protein. Because different mutations cause different defects in the protein, the medications that have been developed so far are effective only in people with specific mutations.</li>
        </ol>
